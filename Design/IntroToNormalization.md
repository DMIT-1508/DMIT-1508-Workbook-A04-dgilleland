## What is Normalization?

<!--
- *"Normalization is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database."*
-->

> *"Normalization is the process of **organizing a database** to 
> 
> - reduce data redundancy and 
> - improve data integrity
> 
> The two main goals of normalization are to eliminate redundant data and ensure that data dependencies make sense. Normalization also simplifies the database design by decomposing a large table into smaller logical units composed of atomic elements."*

## Why Normalize Metadata?

* **Eliminate Redundant Data**: Avoid unnecessary data duplication.
* **Data Integrity**: Ensure data remains consistent and accurate.
* **Optimize Storage**: Efficient use of storage resources.
* **Improve Query Performance**: Faster and more efficient queries.
* **Ease of Maintenance**: Simplified database structure means easier updates and maintenance.
* **Data Security**: Restrict unauthorized data access by segregating data.

## Normal Forms in Databases

* **0NF** (Zero Normal Form) - **Identify all the attributes**
* **1NF** (First Normal Form) - Separate out **Repeating Groups**
* **2NF** (Second Normal Form) - Separate out **Partial Dependencies**
* **3NF** (Third Normal Form) - Separate out **Transitive Dependencies**

## Slide 7: First Normal Form (1NF)

- Image: A table being split into multiple tables.
- Text: 
  - **Definition**: "A relation is in 1NF if it only contains atomic (indivisible) values; there are no repeating groups or arrays."
  - **Example**: Splitting a table with a 'Phone Numbers' column that has multiple numbers into separate rows.

---

## Slide 8: Second Normal Form (2NF)

- Image: A table with some columns highlighted.
- Text: 
  - **Definition**: "A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key."
  - **Example**: Removing partial dependencies where a column depends only on a part of the primary key.

---

## Slide 9: Third Normal Form (3NF)

- Image: A table with arrows pointing to related tables.
- Text: 
  - **Definition**: "A relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all the attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key."
  - **Example**: Removing transitive dependencies where one non-key column depends on another non-key column.

## Slide 10: Analyzing Source Documents

- Image: A magnifying glass over a document.
- Text: "Distinguishing Between Meta-data and Data"

---

## Slide 11: Meta-data vs. Data

- Image: Two contrasting icons representing meta-data and data.
- Text:
  - **Meta-data**: "Data about data. Describes the structure, type, and constraints of actual data."
    - Example: Column names, data types, constraints.
  - **Data**: "Actual information stored in the database."
    - Example: User names, addresses, product names.

## Slide 12: Conclusion

- Image: A recap icon or a summary icon.
- Text: "Normalization ensures efficient, consistent, and secure data storage. By understanding and applying normal forms, we can design robust database systems."

**Slide 13: Thank You & Questions**
- Image: A thank you note or a Q&A icon.
- Text: "Thank you for your attention! Any questions?"

This structure should provide a comprehensive overview of normalization for an introductory database course. Adjustments can be made based on the audience's familiarity with the topic and the duration of the presentation.
