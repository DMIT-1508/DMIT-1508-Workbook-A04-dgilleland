---

## Learning Outcomes (pg 3 of 3)

- Describe the purpose of a `ReadMe.md` file
- Define the term **Markdown**
- List three benefits of using Markdown documents as opposed to tools such as Microsoft Word or languages like HTML

---

### 1. Define DVCS

- **DVCS** stands for Distributed Version Control System.
- Allows multiple users to work on a project without interfering with each other.
- Each user has a complete copy of the repository.

---

### 2. Benefits of Version Control

- Track and revert changes.
- Collaborate with multiple team members.
- Maintain a history of project versions.
- Essential for team-based projects and continuous integration.

---

### 3. Create a Repository

- Navigate to your personal profile on GitHub.com.
- Click on "New Repository".
- Fill in repository details and initialize.

---

### 4. Command Line Management

- Navigate using terminal or command prompt.
- Use commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit`.
- Essential for advanced git operations.

---

### 5. Key Terms

- **Clone**: Copy a repository to your local machine.
- **Commit**: Save changes with a message.
- **Stage**: Prepare changes for a commit.
- **Pull**: Fetch changes from a remote repository.
- **Push**: Send changes to a remote repository.

---

### 6. `.gitignore` File

- Lists files and directories to be ignored by git.
- Useful for excluding sensitive data or build artifacts.
- Each line in the file specifies a pattern.

### 7. `.gitattributes` File

- Defines attributes for paths.
- Can be used to specify line endings, diff settings, and more.
- Helps ensure consistent settings across environments.

---

### 8. Remote vs. Local Repository

- **Remote**: Hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Local**: Resides on your personal computer.
- Changes are made locally and then pushed to the remote.

---

### 9. Synchronization

- Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes.
- Use `git push` to send local changes to the remote.
- Ensures both repositories are up-to-date.

---

### 10. `ReadMe.md` File

- Provides an overview and instructions for the project.
- Typically the first file users see in a repository.
- Can include project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.

---

### 11. Define Markdown

- Lightweight markup language.

- Commonly used for READMEs, documentation, and more.

---

### 12. Benefits of Markdown

- Simple syntax, easy to learn.
- Platform-independent; can be viewed on any device.
- Lightweight compared to Word; more flexible than HTML.
